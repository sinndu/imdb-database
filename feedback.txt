Overall: I think overall, this product functions well. I think it has met all the requirements of rubric and has some clever implementations. All of your ponderings and discussions bore fruit.

Communication:
- Interface is simple. A little disappointed it wasn't the original.
- While it wasn't in the requirements but the lack of error messages for some components felt a bit lacking.
- All the expected components were made.
- Documentation for all the code was made. Explains for functions were provided. I like that the documentations actually explained how the functions work.
- All variables and functions are properly named. 
- 100/100

Thinking:
- Search results averages < 10ms!
- Excellent use of algorithms.
- The most appropriate algorithm was chosen for all problems.
- Algorithms were modified well. 
- Code is mostly concise and efficient. I think there are parts that can be shortened using with for loops and data structures. 
- Hardcoding anything is not good.
- A good solution for dealing with the sorting.
- 95/100

Application:
- Great use of variables and functions.
- Functions were mostly reusable.
	- Some function definitely could be made to help reusability
- Most appropriate data structure was selected for algorithms. 
- No array methods were used.
- Big O is identified for functions. 
- Code naming scheme for functions is not consistent. Shouldn't capitalize the first letter of functions.
